# TrackLog
## Visualize longterm location data

- some collected location data exists in any form
- the data shall be visualized in a map-like form, according to geo coordinates
- the data can be shown raw or statistically enhanced and with error correction
- consecutive collected data can show the frequency of being in a same location
- height and speed can be visualized
- show historic data

Driving through town work-related since 2008 I've collected some GPS data.
I always wanted to do something with that data, e.g. show the heights on
a false-colored map.

This project is an attempt to develop some ideas.
